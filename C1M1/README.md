# Peer-graded Assignment: Week 1 Application Assignment
This programming assignment includes creation of a simple application that performs statistical analytics on a dataset. Begins by setting up a version control repository on local machine. Then developing and testing the code.

# Task Description
You are to write a couple of functions that can analyze an array of unsigned char data items and report analytics on the maximum, minimum, mean, and median of the data set. In addition, you will need to reorder this data set from large to small. All statistics should be rounded down to the nearest integer. After analysis and sorting is done, you will need to print that data to the screen in nicely formatted presentation. You will need to submit a version controlled repository of these 3 files.

 stats.c - Implementation file for your C-programming code

 stats.h -  Header file for your C-programming code

 README.md -  Includes information on the author and the project
